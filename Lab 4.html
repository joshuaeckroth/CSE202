<h2>Task</h2>

<p class="first">Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer (greater
than 1), then determines if that integer is a prime number. It's easy
to check if an integer is prime by just attempting to divide every
number between 1 and the number itself (from the user), exclusive (do
not try to divide by 1 nor the user's number itself because of course
those numbers do divide the user's number); if no such number divides
the number the user provided, then that number is a prime number.</p>

<p>For example, if the user enters the number 37, then your program would
check if 2 divides 37 (it doesn't), then if 3 divides 37 (it doesn't),
and so on, up to if 36 divides 37 (it doesn't). Since no number
between 2 and 36 divides 37, 37 is a prime number.</p>

<p>You must use a <code>for()</code> loop.</p>


<h2>Examples</h2>

<pre class="example">
Enter a positive integer: 36
Not a prime.
</pre>

<pre class="example">
Enter a positive integer: 2
Prime.
</pre>

<pre class="example">
Enter a positive integer: 79
Prime.
</pre>



<h2>Academic misconduct policy</h2>

<p class="first">All writing (prose) and coding for every one of the programming
assignments, labs, and quizzes is to be done individually. DO NOT LOOK
AT OR COPY anyone else's writing or code. DO NOT SHARE your writing or
code with anyone else. The only code you can copy is what you see in
the book and what I provide to you (in class or on this website). If
you are stuck on an assignment or lab, please visit me (or another TA)
during office hours. Suspected cases of academic misconduct will be
filed with the Committee of Academic Misconduct.</p>
