  <h1>Variables, arithmetic, input/output</h1>

  <h2>Variables and types</h2>

  <p>It is very important when writing computer programs that one
  is able to save data in temporary locations, move data in and out
  of these locations and change the data over time. How we do this
  in C++ is with variables.</p>

  <p>Consider the mathematical formula $c = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$
  (Pythagoras' formula). This formula can find the length of the
  hypotenuse of <em>any</em> right triangle. If we were to write a
  program that implemented this formula, then we would have a program
  that can find the length of the hypotenuse of any right
  triangle. This is clearly useful (though perhaps not as its own
  program).</p>

  <p>The reason the letters $a$, $b$, and $c$ are used in the formula
  is because they <em>stand in</em> for whatever values some
  particular right triangle has. Our program would ask for these
  values (specifically, the values for $a$ and $b$ from the user (or
  read them from a file, or whatever). Our program must also save
  these values in variables.</p>

  <p>However, unlike mathematics, C++ variables are <em>typed</em>.
  This means that every variable in C++ is a variable of a certain
  type. We have the following types available to us:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>int</tt> for integers (..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...)</li>

    <li><tt>double</tt> for "floating point" values (i.e. decimal
    values like -0.5 or 1.23040 * 10<sup>-23</sup>)</li>

    <li><tt>string</tt> for "strings" (i.e. text)</li>

    <li><tt>bool</tt> for true/false values</li>

    <li>and some others...</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Variables in C++ are typed for two reasons: (1) programs can
  be executed more efficiently if the type is known beforehand and
  need not be determined based on what kinds of values the user
  provides (technically, this advantage is only gained because C++
  is <em>statically</em> typed, which means the types of variables
  never change while the program is executing); (2) the C++
  compiler is able to ensure that you are using variables the right
  way by checking if you are using values of the right type. For
  example, trying to save a string inside an integer type results
  in an error.</p>

  <h2>Overflow and underflow</h2>

  <p>Computers are finite machines, so they cannot store
  arbitrarily large values or arbitrarily small values (i.e.
  teeny-tiny fractions). Most programs do not need extremely large
  or small values, so very rarely is the fact that computers are
  finite an issue. However, C++ types also have their limits, and
  some of these limits need to be considered when writing any
  program.</p>

  <p>For any general category of types such as integers, decimal
  numbers, etc. C++ has multiple specific types that you can choose
  from to use in your programs. For example, <tt>int</tt> is not
  the only C++ type that stores integer values. There is also
  <tt>char</tt>, <tt>short</tt>, <tt>long</tt>, <tt>long long</tt>,
  and possibly more depending on the compiler. As well,
  <tt>double</tt> is not the only type that can store decimal
  values. There is also <tt>float</tt> and <tt>long double</tt>. A
  quick comparison of these types will help you decide which is
  appropriate for each variable in your program.</p>

  <h3>Integer types</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>char</tt> can store values between -127 and 128
    (signed) or between 0 and 255 (unsigned)</li>

    <li><tt>short</tt> can store values between -32767 and 32767
    (signed) or between 0 and 65535 (unsigned)</li>

    <li><tt>int</tt> can store values between -2147483647 and
    2147483647 (signed) or between 0 and 4294967295</li>

    <li><tt>long</tt> is the same as <tt>int</tt> (on CSE
    server)</li>

    <li><tt>long long</tt> can store values between
    -9223372036854775807 and 9223372036854775807 (signed) or
    between 0 and 18446744073709551615 (unsigned)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Decimal ("floating point") types</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>float</tt> can store values up to +/- 3.40282 *
    10<sup>+/- 38</sup>, 6 precision digits are kept</li>

    <li><tt>double</tt> can store values up to +/- 1.79769 *
    10<sup>+/- 308</sup>, 15 precision digits are kept</li>

    <li><tt>long double</tt> can store values up to +/- 1.7 *
    10<sup>+/- 4932</sup>, 18 precision digits are kept</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Note about precision in floating point types</em> â€” The
  floating point types do not represent values precisely. It is not
  a good idea to do this:</p>
  <pre>
    double x;
    cin &gt;&gt; x;
    if(x == 2.5) // NOT GOOD
    {
        // blah...
    }
  
  </pre>

  <p>The value 2.5 cannot be represented precisely, so even if the
  user inputs 2.5, it may not be stored as 2.5. Thus we cannot test
  if the value is "exactly" 2.5. We must check, instead, if the
  value is "close" to 2.5, using the following approach:</p>
  <pre>
    double x;
    cin &gt;&gt; x;
    if(x &lt; 2.50001 &amp;&amp; x &gt; 2.49999) // YES, GOOD
    {
        // blah...
    }
  </pre>

  <p>For more gory details, see:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href=
	   "http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/comparingfloats.htm"
	   target="_blank">
	http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/comparingfloats.htm</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point"
	   target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Although you may know your program has variables that would
  work just fine as type <tt>short</tt> (for example), it's not
  always the best idea to use <tt>short</tt>. The type
  <tt>short</tt> is relatively uncommon. (Think about metric units:
  although you could use centiliters, it's normal to switch to
  milliliters at that point.) The common types (and what you are
  encouraged to use) are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>True/False values: <tt>bool</tt></li>

    <li>Integers: <tt>int</tt></li>

    <li>Floating point: <tt>double</tt></li>

    <li>Strings: <tt>string</tt> (there are other string types but
    they are not shown here)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Even with these large ranges of values, sometimes your
  variables may suffer overflow or underflow. Overflow occurs when
  you try to store a value that is too large for the type.
  Underflow occurs when you try to store a value that is too small
  for the type. Underflow only makes sense with decimal types: if
  you try to store a very small number, say 0.0 followed by 5000
  0's followed by a 1, not even a <tt>long double</tt> can store
  that value. Overflow and underflow should be rare for the
  programs we are interested in, however.</p>

  <h2>Arithmetic</h2>

  <p>Here are the normal math operators that work on integers and
  floating point numbers:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>+</tt> (add)</li>

    <li><tt>-</tt> (subtract; or a negative number, e.g. <tt>int x
    = -5</tt>)</li>

    <li><tt>*</tt> (multiply)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here are somewhat-unique math operators that work with
  integers:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>/</tt> (quotient: <tt>13 / 5</tt> is 2 because 5 goes
    into 13 two times)</li>

    <li><tt>%</tt> (remainder: <tt>13 % 5</tt> is 3 because the
    remainder of 5/13 is 2)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note that <tt>/</tt> works as you would expect with floating
  point numbers (e.g. <tt>1.2 / 5.6</tt> is about 0.214).</p>

  <p>Precedence works the same as you would expect: <tt>* / %</tt>
  happen before <tt>+ -</tt> so <tt>(5 + 6 % 4 - (3 + 4) / 2)</tt>
  equals 4 as you would expect. You can use parentheses to clarify
  the math.</p>

  <h2>Simple user input</h2>

  <p>To close up this lecture, we'll quickly look at simple user
  input (from the keyboard). You remember using <tt>cout</tt> to
  display a message. You can use <tt>cin</tt> to do the opposite:
  get input from the user. It works like this (notice the
  <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> of <tt>cin</tt>, which are opposite those of
  <tt>cout</tt>):</p>
  <pre>
    int x;
    cout &lt;&lt; "Give me a number: ";
    cin &gt;&gt; x;
    cout &lt;&lt; "You gave me the number " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;
  </pre>

  <p>You can use <tt>cin</tt> for integer types, floating point
  types, string types, and others. It's easiest if you ask the user
  to enter one value at a time, pressing Enter between each
  value.</p>

  <p>To acquire multiple values at once, just string them together
  with <tt>cin</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
    int x;
    double y;
    short z;
    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter three numeric values: ";
    cin &gt;&gt; x &gt;&gt; y &gt;&gt; z;
  </pre>

  <p>This is equivalent to:</p>
  <pre>
    int x;
    double y;
    short z;
    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter three numeric values: ";
    cin &gt;&gt; x;
    cin &gt;&gt; y;
    cin &gt;&gt; z;
  </pre>

  <h2>Printing with precision</h2>

  <p>When printing "floating-point values" (such as floats,
  doubles, etc.) we often need to show a specific number of digits
  after the decimal point. This is known as the "precision" of the
  number. The actual precision of the value will not change; we
  will only change the printed precision. The following will show
  three digits after the decimal point:</p>
  <pre>
    cout.precision(3);
    sout.setf(ios::fixed, ios::floatfield);
  </pre>

  <p>Here is a complete example:</p>

  <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    using namespace std;
    int main()
    {
        double x;
        cout &lt;&lt; "Enter value for x: ";
        cin &gt;&gt; x;
    
        cout.precision(3);
        cout.setf(ios::fixed, ios::floatfield);
    
        cout &lt;&lt; "You entered " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;
        return 0;
    }
  </pre>

  <p>For example,</p>
  <pre>
    Enter value for x: 4.444444
    You entered 4.444
  </pre>
  <pre>
    Enter value for x: 0.0000001
    You entered 0.000
  </pre>
  <pre>
    Enter value for x: 123.45678
    You entered 123.457
  </pre>
  
  <p>Notice how the last printout rounded up; the value of "x"
    inside the program has not changed, however.</p>
  
  <h2>Variable naming</h2>

  <p>Here are the rules for naming variables:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>1 to 255 characters</li>

    <li>must begin with a letter or _</li>

    <li>after the first letter or _, can contain numbers</li>

    <li>uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different
    (e.g. <tt>xyz</tt> is not the same variable as
    <tt>Xyz</tt>)</li>

    <li>"reserved" words cannot be used (e.g. "using" "namespace"
    "if" "else" etc.)</li>

    <li>do not use all uppercase letters unless the variable is a
    "constant" ("constant" means its value never changes; e.g.
    <tt>const double PI = 3.14159</tt> is a proper use of all
    uppercase letters)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Declaring variables</h2>

  <p>Just as a convention, declare all the variables you need in a
  function at the top of the function. For example, this is
  good:</p>
  <pre>
    int main() {
        double xyz;
        int abc;
        // do stuff...
        return 0;
    }
  </pre>

  <p>while this is not preferred:</p>
  <pre>
    int main() {
        // do stuff...
        double xyz;
        int abc;
    
        // do more stuff...
        return 0;
    }
  </pre>

  <p>You can declare multiple variables in one line (separated by
  commas), if they are all of the same type:</p>
  <pre>
    double a, b, c, d, e, f, g;
    int x, y, z;
  </pre>

  <p>You can also give them values:</p>
  <pre>
    double a = 1.1, b = 2.2, c = 3.3;
    int x = 1, y = 2, z = 3;
  </pre>

  <p>Declare and define constant values like this (using all caps
  for the variable names):</p>
  <pre>
    const double PI = 3.14159;
    const int MULTIPLIER = 5;
  </pre>

  <p>Because these variables have the modifier <tt>const</tt>, you
  are not allowed to change their values (the compiler will display
  an error if you try).</p>

  <h2>Arithmetic shorthand</h2>

  <p>You can use the following shorthand for changing the values of
  variables. The shorthand form is shown, then the equivalent form
  is described in comments.</p>
  <pre>
    double a = 0.0;
    int x = 0;
    x++;            // same as: x = x + 1;
    x--;            // same as: x = x - 1;
    x += 2;         // same as: x = x + 2;
    x -= 2;         // same as: x = x - 2;
    x *= 2;         // same as: x = x * 2;
    x /= 2;         // same as: x = x / 2;
    x %= 2;         // same as: x = x % 2;
    
    a += 2.0;       // same as: a = a + 2.0;
    // etc.
  </pre>

  <h2>Boolean operators</h2>

  <p>Variables of type <tt>bool</tt> have the following special
  operators:</p>
  <pre>
    bool p = TRUE;
    bool q = FALSE;
    bool r;
    r = !p;        // "!" means "not" or "opposite", so r == FALSE
    r = p || q;    // "||" means "or", so r == TRUE
    r = p &amp;&amp; q;    // "&amp;&amp;" means "and", so r == FALSE
    r = q || (!p)  // r == FALSE
  </pre>
  
  <p>Note that you cannot use "shorthand" operators with Boolean
    variables. The following does <em>not</em> do what you expect:
    <tt>r != p;</tt></p>
  
  <h2>Input from the user</h2>
  
  <p>We quickly looked at how to get input from the user. Here it
    is again:</p>
  <pre>
    double a;
    int x;
    bool p;
    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter a decimal value: ";
    cin &gt;&gt; a;
    
    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter an integer value: ";
    cin &gt;&gt; x;
    
    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter a 0 for FALSE, anything else for TRUE: ";
    cin &gt;&gt; p;
  </pre>
  
  <p>The function <tt>cin</tt> only collects input up to the first
    space or newline.</p>
