  <h1>Conditionals</h1>

  <h2>Motivation</h2>

  <p>It is a very rare program that solves a problem with the exact
  same sequence of operations every time it is executed. What is
  more common is a program that does some operations if the data or
  user input looks a certain way, and a different set of operations
  if the data looks a different way.</p>

  <p>The way we can do this in C++ is with "conditionals." The word
  "conditional" means that some operations will only occur if a
  certain "condition" is true.</p>

  <p>For example, consider the program that gives the user three
  attempts to guess a number between 1 and 10. Here is what the
  program should do (in pseudo-code):</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Ask the user for the first guess. Save this guess into a
    variable called <tt>guess1</tt>.</li>

    <li>If <tt>guess1</tt> is the correct guess, then tell the user
    "Success!" and quit.</li>

    <li>If <tt>guess1</tt> is not the correct guess, then tell the
    user "Nope. Try another guess." and save the second guess into
    a variable called <tt>guess2</tt>.</li>

    <li>If <tt>guess2</tt> is the correct guess, then tell the user
    "Success!" and quit.</li>

    <li>If <tt>guess2</tt> is not the correct guess, then tell the
    user "Nope. Try another guess." and save the third guess into a
    variable called <tt>guess3</tt>.</li>

    <li>If <tt>guess3</tt> is the correct guess, then tell the user
    "Success!" and quit.</li>

    <li>If <tt>guess3</tt> is not the correct guess, then tell the
    user "Nope. You are not allowed any more guesses, sorry! The
    number you failed to guess was [the number]." (where "the
    number" is the real number).</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>How to do it in code</h2>

  <p>In C++, we have a command called <tt>if</tt>. This is what it
  looks like:</p>

  <pre>
    if(...something...)
    {
        // do stuff...
    }
  </pre>

  <p>Of course, we need to change the phrase
  <tt>...something...</tt> to a "conditional." The <tt>if</tt>
  command expects something that results in a <tt>bool</tt> value.
  So we can use <tt>bool</tt> values like <tt>true</tt> and
  <tt>false</tt>:</p>

  <pre>
    if(true)
    {
        // do stuff...
    }
    if(false)
    {
        // do stuff...
    }
  </pre>

  <p>But these conditionals (<tt>true</tt> and <tt>false</tt>) are
  not very interesting because in the first case, the stuff inside
  the <tt>if</tt> block will always be executed (a "block" is the
  stuff being <tt>{</tt> and <tt>}</tt>). In the second case, the
  stuff in the block will never be executed.</p>

  <p>More interesting conditionals may involve the following
  boolean operators (assuming <tt>p</tt> and <tt>q</tt> are
  <tt>bool</tt> variables and <tt>x</tt> is an <tt>int</tt>
  variable):</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>!p</tt> &mdash; "not p" or "opposite of the value that p
    has"</li>

    <li><tt>p || q</tt> &mdash; "p or q"</li>

    <li><tt>p &amp;&amp; q</tt> &mdash; "p and q"</li>

    <li><tt>x == 5</tt> &mdash; "the value in the variable x is equal to
    5"</li>

    <li><tt>x != 5</tt> &mdash; "the value in the variable x is not equal
    to 5"</li>

    <li><tt>x &lt; 5</tt></li>

    <li><tt>x &gt; 5</tt></li>

    <li><tt>x &lt;= 5</tt> &mdash; "the value in the variable x is less
    than or equal to 5"</li>

    <li><tt>x &gt;= 5</tt></li>

    <li><tt>(x &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (x &lt;= 5)</tt> &mdash; "x is between
    0 and 5" (x can be one of [0,1,2,3,4,5]); note that you
    <em>cannot</em> say <tt>(0 &lt;= x &lt;= 5) (wrong!)</tt></li>
  </ul>

  <p>So we can write our guessing program like this:</p>

  <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    using namespace std;
    int main()
    {
        int answer = 8;
        int guess;
    
        cout &lt;&lt; "Enter first guess: ";
        cin &gt;&gt; guess;

        if(answer == guess)
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Success!";
            return 0;
        }
    
        cout &lt;&lt; "Nope. Try another guess." &lt;&lt; endl;
        cout &lt;&lt; "Enter second guess: ";
        cin &gt;&gt; guess;
    
        if(answer == guess)
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Success!";
            return 0;
        }
    
        cout &lt;&lt; "Nope. Try another guess." &lt;&lt; endl;
        cout &lt;&lt; "Enter third guess: ";
        cin &gt;&gt; guess;

        if(answer == guess)
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Success!";
            return 0;
        }
    
        cout &lt;&lt; "Nope. You are not allowed any more guesses, sorry!" &lt;&lt; endl;
        cout &lt;&lt; "The number you failed to guess was " &lt;&lt; answer &lt;&lt; endl;
    
        return -1;
    }
  </pre>

  <h2>if/else</h2>

  <p>Besides <tt>if</tt> we can also use <tt>else</tt> to specify
  some operations that should be executed if the conditional is
  <em>not</em> satisfied. Example:</p>

  <pre>
    if(x == 5)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "x equals 5!" &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
    else
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "x does not equal 5!" &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
  </pre>

  <h2>Nested if's</h2>

  <p><tt>if</tt> commands can be inside other <tt>if</tt> (or
  <tt>else</tt>) blocks:</p>

  <pre>
    if(x &lt; 5)
    {
        if(x &lt; 0)
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "x is less than 0!" &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
        else
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "x is less than 5 but not less than 0!" &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "x is not less than 5!" &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
  </pre>

  <h2>Series of if/else's</h2>

  <p>It is common practice to check a series of conditions, where
  you only expect one of them to be true:</p>

  <pre>
    if(x == 0)
    {
        // do stuff...
    }
    else if(x == 1)
    {
        // do stuff...
    }
    else if(x == 2)
    {
        // do stuff...
    }
    else
    {
        // fallback...
    }
  </pre>

  <h2>"switch" statements</h2>

  <p>An alternative to the above example (series of if/else's) is
  the <tt>switch</tt> statement. The <tt>switch</tt> statement is the
  same as a series of if/else's because only one of the conditions
  should turn out to be true.  The <tt>switch</tt> statement can only
  handle simple conditions, however; actually, it can only handle
  conditions of the form "is some integer equal to some value?" This
  means that a <tt>switch</tt> statement can only be used for
  integers.</p>

  <p>Here is an example.</p>

  <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    using namespace std;
    int main()
    {
        int number;
        cout &lt;&lt; "Enter a number 1-4: ";
        cin &gt;&gt; number;
    
        switch(number)
        {
        case 1:
            cout &lt;&lt; "You entered the number 1." &lt;&lt; endl;
            break;
        case 2:
            cout &lt;&lt; "You entered the number 2." &lt;&lt; endl;
            break;
        case 3:
            cout &lt;&lt; "You entered the number 3." &lt;&lt; endl;
            break;
        case 4:
            cout &lt;&lt; "You entered the number 4." &lt;&lt; endl;
            break;
        default:
            cout &lt;&lt; "You must have entered some other number." &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
    
        return 0;
    }
  </pre>

  <p>The <tt>switch</tt> statement above can be rewritten with a
  series of if/else's:</p>

  <pre>
    // the following is the same as the "switch" statement above
    if(number == 1)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "You entered the number 1." &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
    else if(number == 2)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "You entered the number 2." &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
    else if(number == 3)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "You entered the number 3." &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
    else if(number == 4)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "You entered the number 4." &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
    else
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "You must have entered some other number." &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
  </pre>


  <p>Notice that an <tt>if</tt> is much more powerful: you can use
  very complicated conditionals. However, a <tt>switch</tt> is very
  simple: for each "case", you provide a value that is compared to the
  variable used in the switch (in this case, the variable used in the
  switch is "number"). Each case basically asks, "does the value in
  the variable equal this number?"</p>

  <p>Each "case" in a <tt>switch</tt> needs a "break" at the end so
  that the next case is not entered. It's good practice to always
  include a "break" at the end of each case in a <tt>switch</tt>.</p>

  <p>The "default" case is the case that is used if all the other
  cases fail.</p>

  <p>You can also use a <tt>switch</tt> to determine which character a
  user typed, since characters are themselves just integers. Here is
  an example:</p>

  <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    using namespace std;
    int main()
    {
        char letter;
        cout &lt;&lt; "Enter a letter: ";
        cin &gt;&gt; letter;
    
        switch(letter)
        {
        case 'a':
            cout &lt;&lt; "You entered the letter 'a'." &lt;&lt; endl;
            break;
        case 'b':
            cout &lt;&lt; "You entered the letter 'b'." &lt;&lt; endl;
            break;
        default:
            cout &lt;&lt; "You must have entered some other letter." &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
    
        return 0;
    }
  </pre>
