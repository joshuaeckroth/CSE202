    <p>About C++:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>one of many languages</li>

      <li>a superset of C -- C code still passes as C++ code</li>

      <li>an ALGOL-like structure and syntax

	<ul>
          <li>C++ has lots of braces, semicolons</li>

          <li>Each command is usually typed on a new line, runs top
            to bottom, left to right</li>

          <li>Doesn't have to be that way: don't really need
            semicolons and braces (Python), don't really need top-down
            left-right (Haskell), don't really need to type in files
            (Max)</li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>We are learning C++ for a host of reasons: historical (was
	C or Pascal previously, which are similar), practical (common
	today), social (languages pushed by tool makers), etc.</li>

      <li>Overall point is to utilize computers in our research and
	jobs

	<ul>
          <li>This can be done with virtually any programming
            language</li>

          <li>Topics in this class, could be taught with virtually
            any language

            <ul>
              <li>It is also relatively hard to teach C++ because of
		all the syntax and other oddities (mostly relating to
		the fact it's compatible with the older C
		language)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Then go over syllabus, learning objectives.</p>

    <p>Expectations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Expect you to do all the work on time

	<ul>
          <li>Programming assignments can be turned in 1 week late
            for a maximum grade of 85% on that assignment</li>

          <li>Programming assignments are always due 1 week after
            they are assigned; that is, they are due on Tuesdays, by
            1:00pm in the Carmen dropbox</li>

          <li>A programming assignment should take maybe 3 hours
            max</li>

          <li>Labs are always due the day of the lab, by 3:30pm in
            the Carmen dropbox (except Lab 1; I'm not so worried about
            due dates for that one)</li>

          <li>Labs are short and to the point -- they should take
            about 30 min max</li>

          <li>Mini-quizzes are online in Carmen; they are available
            for about a week and must be done by Fridays 5:00pm</li>

          <li>Mini-quizzes are very short and simple, usually just a
            couple questions; you have 1 hour to complete them after
            you begin them (they must be completed by Fridays 5:00pm);
            they should really only take a few minutes to complete, if
            you already know the material</li>

          <li>Programming assignments and labs should be tested with
            the tester program I wrote; I will demo that later; the
            tester assists me in my grading, and it also assists you
            not only to see if you program is correct, but also to
            learn what the correct output is (I will not write that
            information in the programming assignment and lab
            descriptions; you can find it in the tester)</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Then describe what we are going to do in the lab.</p>

    <p>C++ style:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Show basic template in jEdit; describe each part</li>

      <li>Show basic "cout", compile, execute</li>

      <li>Diagram compiling process, talk about file names (and Unix
	vs Windows)</li>
    </ul>
