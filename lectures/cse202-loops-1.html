  <h1>Loops 1</h1>

  <h2>Motivation</h2>

  <p>So far our programs have not used any loops. A loop is a
  repetition of some section of code. Loops are essential in the
  common situation where user input or data determines how many
  times something should occur. In other cases, the programmer just
  wants to save time by reducing the amount of typing or
  copy-pasting required, as our first example below shows.</p>

  <p>Consider the simple example of the "bottles of beer" song.
  This is how it goes (as far as I know):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer, take one
    down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.<br />
    <br />
    98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer, take one
    down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.<br />
    <br />
    97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer, take one
    down, pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the wall.<br />
    <br />
    ...<br />
    <br />
    1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer, take it down,
    pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Clearly this is a loop. (But a program that prints these
  lyrics need not use loops, since you know it should print 100
  lines. You could just use 100 separate <tt>cout</tt> statements.
  Using a loop, on the other hand, saves us from such tedium.)</p>

  <p>There are many examples of tasks that require loops. An
  interactive program that asks the user to input a value, then
  performs a computation on that input, then asks the user to input
  another value, and so on, until the user decides to quit, must
  use loops.</p>

  <p>In this lecture, we will look at the 99-bottles-of-beer loop
  and the interactive program loop.</p>

  <h2>Building up to 99 bottles of beer</h2>

  <p>In C++, the simplest loop is the <tt>while</tt> loop. Here is
  a <tt>while</tt> loop that prints the first line of the song,
  forever and ever (infinitely-many copies of this same lyric are
  shown on the screen):</p>
  <pre>
    while(true)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "99 bottles of beer on the wall... "
             &lt;&lt; "pass it around, 98 bottles..."
             &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
  
</pre>

  <p>The general format for a <tt>while</tt> loop is:</p>
  <pre>
    while(conditional)
    {
        // do stuff...
    }
  
</pre>

  <p>where <tt>conditional</tt> is the same kind of conditional
  used in <tt>if</tt> statements. In other words,
  <tt>conditional</tt> must be something that is a <tt>bool</tt>
  result.</p>

  <p>In an <tt>if</tt> statement, there is no repetition, so the
  conditional is only checked once. In a <tt>while</tt> loop, on
  the other hand, the conditional is checked before the loop begins
  and after every time the stuff inside the loop is executed. In
  other words, first <tt>conditional</tt> is checked. If it turns
  out to be true, then <tt>stuff...</tt> is executed. Then
  <tt>conditional</tt> is checked again. If it is true,
  <tt>stuff...</tt> is executed. And so on, looping over and over
  so long as <tt>conditional</tt> is true. If at some point
  <tt>conditional</tt> is false, then <tt>stuff...</tt> is not
  executed and the loop is finished. Execution resumes after the
  <tt>while</tt> loop block (a block starts with <tt>{</tt> and
  ends with <tt>}</tt>).</p>

  <p>We saw a "degenerate" loop earlier. It started with
  <tt>while(true)</tt>. A loop like that never stops because the
  conditional is always true. Another degenerate case is
  <tt>while(false)</tt>. In this case, since the conditional is
  never true, the stuff inside the block never executes. We will
  see later that <tt>while(true)</tt> actually can be useful in a
  program, but <tt>while(false)</tt> is never useful.</p>

  <p>A loop can be stopped by two techniques. The first technique
  will be discussed now. A loop stops when the conditional is
  false. Consider this loop:</p>
  <pre>
    while(x != 0)
    {
        // do stuff...
    }
  
</pre>

  <p>This loop is stopped only when <tt>x == 0</tt> because that is
  the only case when the conditional is false. This suggests that
  somewhere inside the loop, <tt>x</tt> has to change such that,
  eventually, <tt>x</tt> is given the value <tt>0</tt>. If that
  never happens inside the loop, the loop never ends.</p>

  <p>Consider the bottles of beer again. Here is a loop that mostly
  works:</p>
  <pre>
    int n = 99;
    while(n &gt; 0)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; " bottles of beer..."
             &lt;&lt; "take one down..."
             &lt;&lt; (n-1) &lt;&lt; " bottles of beer..."
             &lt;&lt; endl;
        n--;
    }
  </pre>

  <p>See how in that case, the conditional <tt>n &gt; 0</tt> does
  eventually become false, because <tt>n</tt> is decreased each
  time the loop executes.</p>

  <p>In the last code segment, the final bottles-of-beer lyric is
  not handled properly. Here is a fix:</p>
  <pre>
    int n = 99;
    while(n &gt; 1)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; " bottles of beer..."
             &lt;&lt; "take one down..."
             &lt;&lt; (n-1) &lt;&lt; " bottles of beer..."
             &lt;&lt; endl;
         n--;
    }
    cout &lt;&lt; "1 bottle of beer ..." &lt;&lt; endl;
  </pre>

  <p>The last case, when <tt>n == 1</tt>, is special so we put it
  outside the loop.</p>

  <h2>Interactive program</h2>
  <pre>
    char c;
    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter a letter, 's' to skip the message, 'q' to quit: ";
    cin &gt;&gt; c;
    while(c != 'q')
    {
        if(c != 's')
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "You typed " &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
        cout &lt;&lt; "Enter a letter, 's' to skip the message, 'q' to quit: ";
        cin &gt;&gt; c;
    }
  </pre>
