    <h1>Assignment 4</h1>
    <!-- Page published by Emacs Muse begins here -->
<h2>Task</h2>

<p class="first">Write a program that asks the user for a phrase. Save this phrase into
a string (use <code>getline(cin, s)</code>, where <code>s</code> is your <code>string</code> variable). Then
check if the string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is word or
phrase that reads the same forwards as it does backwards. In our case,
the phrase must have spaces and punctuation in the correct locations
both forwards and backwards (in other words, we are not &quot;ignoring&quot;
spaces and punctuation).</p>


<h2>Examples</h2>

<pre class="example">
Enter a phrase: hello
Not a palindrome.
</pre>

<pre class="example">
Enter a phrase: able was I ere I saw elba
Is a palindrome.
</pre>

<pre class="example">
Enter a phrase: racecar
Is a palindrome.
</pre>

<pre class="example">
Enter a phrase: ! !oxo! !
Is a palindrome.
</pre>

<h2>Academic misconduct policy</h2>

<p class="first">All writing (prose) and coding for every one of the programming
assignments, labs, and quizzes is to be done individually. DO NOT LOOK
AT OR COPY anyone else's writing or code. DO NOT SHARE your writing or
code with anyone else. The only code you can copy is what you see in
the book and what I provide to you (in class or on this website). If
you are stuck on an assignment or lab, please visit me (or another TA)
during office hours. Suspected cases of academic misconduct will be
filed with the Committee of Academic Misconduct.</p>
