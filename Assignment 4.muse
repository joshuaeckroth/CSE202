* Task

Let <math>f</math> be the function

  <math>f(x, y) = \cos(x) \sin(y) \log(x + y + 1)</math>

where <math>\log</math> is the natural logarithm (sometimes written
<math>\ln</math>).

Write a program that asks the user for integers <math>m</math> and
<math>n</math> and computes and writes <math>f(i/5,j/5)</math> to the
file "outfile.txt" for <math>0 \leq i < m</math> and <math>0 \leq j <
n</math>. The output (in the file) should be formatted as an <math>m
\times n</math> matrix where <math>i</math> is the matrix row number
and <math>j</math> is the matrix column number.

In more detail:

  1. Prompt and then read in the values of <math>m</math> and
     <math>n</math>. (These two numbers may be different.)

  2. Your program should open the file "outdata.txt" and check that
     the file is open.  Output an error message and exit if the
     program could not open the file.

  3. For each value of <math>i</math> from <math>0</math> to
     <math>m-1</math> and for each value of <math>j</math> from
     <math>0</math> to <math>n-1</math>, compute and output
     <math>f(i/5,j/5)</math>. Note that the first values of
     <math>i</math> and <math>j</math> are both <math>0</math> and the
     last values are <math>m-1</math> and <math>n-1</math>,
     respectively.

  4. Output should be formatted in an <math>m \times n</math>
     matrix. Each row of the matrix should be a single line in the
     output file consisting of m numbers. An example of the output
     format is shown below.

  5. Output the numbers in fixed precision with precision set to
     3. Format the output so that the decimal point lines up in each
     column and columns are separated by one or more blanks. Note that
     the output may be negative, so leave space for a minus sign. The
     easiest way to do this is with the "tab" character ="\t"=.

  6. Close the file "outdata.txt".

  7. *(Just for fun)* On Linux in the lab, Visualize a surface
     representing the output of your program using Matlab. Type
     =matlab &= to start matlab. Within Matlab, type =load outdata.txt=
     and then type =surf(outdata)= . Also try clicking, in the "Figure"
     window, the menu "Tools" and the option "Rotate3D", to rotate the
     figure. Note that for Matlab to correctly read and process the
     output, output must be formatted in an <math>m \times n</math>
     matrix where each row of the matrix is a single line in the
     output file consisting of <math>n</math> numbers.
