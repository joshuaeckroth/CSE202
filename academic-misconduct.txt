* Academic misconduct policy

All writing (prose) and coding for every one of the programming
assignments, labs, and quizzes is to be done individually. DO NOT LOOK
AT OR COPY anyone else's writing or code. DO NOT SHARE your writing or
code with anyone else. The only code you can copy is what you see in
the book and what I provide to you (in class or on this website). If
you are stuck on an assignment or lab, please visit me (or another TA)
during office hours. Suspected cases of academic misconduct will be
filed with the Committee of Academic Misconduct.
