    <h1>Lab 1</h1>
    <!-- Page published by Emacs Muse begins here -->
<h2>Log into Windows</h2>

<ol>
<li>Go to Caldwell (CL) 112A; (Note: Tuesday labs meet in CL 112A. At
other times, you can use 112A as long as there is no class in
there. The computers outside 112A are the same so you can use
those, too.)</li>

<li>Log into a computer. I will give you your username. Your starting
password for Windows is of the format: <code>####xx!</code> where <code>####</code> are the
last 4 digits of your OSU ID number and <code>xx</code> are your first and
last initials in lowercase. For example, assume Jim Smith's OSU
ID is 123456789, then his initial password would be <code>6789js!</code></li>

<li>You'll be prompted to create a new password. Your new password
must contain a secret mix of symbols, uppercase/lowercase
letters, numbers, etc. We've never been able to figure out the
exact rules. But choose something you won't forget! (I cannot
help you if you forget your password. If you do forget your
password, you will have to reset the password in the &quot;SOC&quot; lab on
the 8th floor of Dreese.)</li>
</ol>


<h2>Log into Linux</h2>

<p><em>Note: These same steps can be performed on your own computer. You will
be able to connect to the lab computers from home with these same
steps.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Download Putty and save to your Desktop. Putty is here:
<a href="http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe">http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe</a></li>

<li>Double-click putty.exe to open it. Type in the &quot;host name&quot; field
the following: <code>stdlogin.cse.ohio-state.edu</code></li>

<li>Then click the &quot;Open&quot; button at the bottom of the window.</li>

<li>You will be asked if you want to trust the &quot;host key&quot;; say &quot;yes.&quot;</li>

<li>Then provide your user name, press Enter, and then provide your
password. Your password (until you change it) is the same as your
first password (with your ID numbers) but without the exclamation
point. That is, <code>####xx</code> &mdash; in the example above, it would be
<code>6789js</code></li>

<li>After this, you should be logged in and looking at the &quot;shell&quot;,
which is waiting for you to type commands.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Create a new directory for Lab 1</h2>

<ol>
<li>In the Putty window, type <code>cd</code> and press enter. The <code>cd</code> command
(&quot;change directory&quot;) changes your &quot;location&quot; in the terminal
window. Typing <code>cd</code> and pressing enter changes the directory (your
location) to your &quot;home directory&quot;.</li>

<li>Type <code>mkdir lab1</code> and press enter. The <code>mkdir</code> command creates
(&quot;makes&quot;) a new directory.</li>

<li>Now we will change our location to the directory you just
made. Type <code>cd lab1</code> and press enter.</li>

<li>This process (<code>cd</code> then <code>mkdir labX</code> then <code>cd labX</code>) should be
performed at the start of each lab or programming
assignment. Each lab/assignment will have its own directory so
that your files are organized.</li>

<li>Each time you come back to work on a lab or assignment, after you
log in to Linux with Putty (whether from home or school, it is
the same), you must change your location to the lab's or
assignment's directory. For example, if you come back later to
work on this lab, you must open Putty, log in, and type <code>cd</code> then
<code>cd lab1</code>. You do not need to type <code>mkdir lab1</code> again.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Type some code</h2>

<ol>
<li>Once you are done with the previous steps, you can begin writing
code (or continue working on code you have already started). You
have a choice of programs to use to write your code; there are
many available (I mention several in <a href="Compilers%20and%20editors.html">Compilers and editors</a>). In
these notes, I'll use &quot;nano&quot;.

<p>Type <code>nano main.cpp</code> to open the nano editor with the file (which
is blank since it does not exist) called &quot;main.cpp&quot;. We will
write our code in this file.</p></li>

<li>Type the following code:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"></p>
</blockquote> 

<pre class="src">
<span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">lab 1
</span><span style="color: #da70d6;">#include</span> <span style="color: #bc8f8f;">&lt;iostream&gt;</span>
<span style="color: #a020f0;">using</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">namespace</span> <span style="color: #5f9ea0;">std</span>;

<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">main</span>()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; <span style="color: #bc8f8f;">"Wow C++ is easy!"</span> &lt;&lt; endl;
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> 0;
}
</pre>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Change the message in the quotes if you don't agree.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Then save the file by typing Ctrl-O. Hit Enter when it asks for
the file name.</li>

<li>Then quit nano by typing Ctrl-X.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Compile the code</h2>

<ol>
<li>Back at the shell (outside of your editor), type: <code>g++ main.cpp</code></li>

<li>If the command was successful (which means you see nothing), then
you can type <code>a.out</code> to run the program. (The program is called
&quot;a.out&quot; since we did not tell the compiler to call the program
anything in particular; it has to choose a name and &quot;a.out&quot; is
what it always chooses).</li>

<li>If you see a bunch of errors, ask me for help and go back to the
steps in the &quot;Type some code&quot; section.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Submit your code</h2>

<ol>
<li>Assuming your program works, you'll need to send it to me so I
can grade it. I want the programs sent in an email (not as an
attachment, just inside the email, copy-and-pasted if
necessary). If you are still in Linux/Putty, it's super easy
to email me your code. Just type</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"></p>
</blockquote> 

<pre class="example">
mail joshuaeckroth@gmail.com &lt; main.cpp
</pre>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">and press Enter. That command sends me an email (because that's
my email address) and makes the text of the email the same as
your code (in the file &quot;main.cpp&quot;). So I get an email that just
contains your code (not even an email &quot;subject&quot;; just your
code). This is why it is important to put a comment at the top of
your code indicating which lab/assignment you are sending me.</p>
</blockquote>


<h2>Put your code on a flash drive (if you want)</h2>

<ol>
<li>You can quit Putty (type &quot;exit&quot; at the shell) and still get to
your code if you are using a lab computer. Your &quot;home directory&quot;
in Linux is the same as the Z: drive in Windows. So just open up
&quot;Computer&quot; in the Start Menu and find the Z: drive. You'll see
the directory &quot;lab1&quot; that you made earlier.</li>
</ol>
