    <h1>Adventure and hackers</h1>
    <!-- Page published by Emacs Muse begins here -->
<p><em>Quoted from:</em> Sherry Turkle, <em>The Second Self: Computers and the Human
Spirit</em>, MIT Press 1984; pp 205-207.</p>

<p>During my interview with Ron I expressed frustration at not knowing
the &quot;feel&quot; of hacking. He came back with a plan of action, the same
that was suggested to Tracy Kidder in the basement of Data General
when he wanted to experience what draws someone into becoming a
&quot;Midnight Programmer.&quot; Ron typed some commands at his terminal and set
me to playing the game of <em>Adventure</em>.</p>

<p>In <em>Adventure</em> the computer creates a complex underground world. You are
in a clearing in the forest, standing before a house. It is up to you
to find the grate which, if you open it correctly, will put you into
Colossal Cave. The computer will move you through this world in
response to the commands you type on the keyboard. Each time you move,
a new message appears on the screen telling you where you are (a room,
a dark tunnel, a maze, a passageway) and what objects and beings are
there with you. At each point you must convey a two-word instruction
saying what you want to do next. You can choose direction, and you can
pick up things, drop things, open things, close things. In principle,
you are trying to get the treasure, but even after months of playing,
drawing maps, struggling with strategies, very few players are able to
do so. Most have been permanently stalled by dragons, trolls, snakes,
or hatchet-hurling dwarfs. Each of these adversaries can be conquered,
but only through complicated strategies. The program will let you
carry only so many things at a time, so if you face a rusty door you
will probably decide to drop the water you are carrying, which might
be useful later, but now will only make rust rustier, and go back to
retrieve the oil can that you passed on the trail fourteen moves
ago. On your way back to the oil, a path you can find only if you have
been making a map as you proceed, you may be outwitted if you forget
to bring something to carry it in. Finally, perhaps several hours
later, if you are not skillful, you will have retraced your steps back
to the rusty door.</p>

<p><em>Adventure</em> is a window onto a way of experiencing the computer. The
experience it gave me was of a far different order from what I had
gotten from a beginning course in computer programming. There I
learned to write simple instructions and got to watch the computer
following them. Like most people, I came out of this with a vision of
the machine and of programming as simple, controllable, linear. &quot;The
machine is dumb, just a giant calculator,&quot; the professor had
said. &quot;Programming is a straightforward act of mechanical
regurgitation. Garbage in, garbage out.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Adventure</em> has nothing in common with writing a simple program in an
introductory course. However, it is Adventure that better captures the
hacker's experience of living with his code. It is the introductory
computer course that fails to give its students a sense of what
programming is to its virtuosi. When systems get complex they become
worlds that you can live in.</p>

<p>Imagine yourself at the computer. You are a systems programmer. A
truly peculiar piece of behavior&mdash;a bug&mdash;has been reported by a fellow
hacker. You have printed out the program on a stack of folded
paper. It has twenty thousand lines of code. Somewhere in all that is
the cause of the bug. How will you find it? It is like being lost in
Colossal Cave. You come to a &quot;place&quot; in the cave. You don't see what
you are looking for, but you see something that might be relevant
later if you can remember where it was and find your way back to
it. You debug your game by developing the skill of getting through the
maze.</p>

<p>Cultures take their central experiences and play with them through
fantasy, ritual, and art. When &quot;winning&quot; is at the center of cultural
life, a game takes on this role. For the hacker, where what is most
central is mastery over complexity, the game takes the form of a
labyrinth.</p>
