    <h1>Lab 3</h1>
    <!-- Page published by Emacs Muse begins here -->
<h2>Task</h2>

<p class="first">Write a complete program that asks the user for a &quot;formula.&quot; A formula
is of the form &quot;number operation number&quot; where &quot;number&quot; is some
decimal number, and &quot;operation&quot; is one of <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>/</code> (you can use
a <code>char</code> variable to get the operation, since they are always just one
symbol). An example is the formula <code>4.3 + 3.2</code>.  Your program should
compute the answer to the formula and print it (with fixed precision
3). Be sure to use a <code>switch</code> statement to determine which operation was
entered.</p>


<h2>Examples</h2>

<pre class="example">
Enter a simple mathematical formula: 0.0 + 0.0
Answer: 0.000
</pre>

<pre class="example">
Enter a simple mathematical formula: 123.45 - 123.45
Answer: 0.000
</pre>

<pre class="example">
Enter a simple mathematical formula: 5.67 * -84.27
Answer: -477.811
</pre>

<pre class="example">
Enter a simple mathematical formula: -3497.45 / 354.3385045
Answer: -9.870
</pre>

<p>For the following example, &quot;inf&quot; is automatically printed whenever you
divided a double by 0.0. You do not need a special check for 0.0.</p>

<pre class="example">
Enter a simple mathematical formula: 35 / 0
Answer: inf
</pre>

<p>Same with &quot;nan&quot; (&quot;not a number&quot;); it is automatically printed when 0.0
is divided by 0.0.</p>

<pre class="example">
Enter a simple mathematical formula: 0.0 / 0.0
Answer: nan
</pre>

<h2>Academic misconduct policy</h2>

<p class="first">All writing (prose) and coding for every one of the programming
assignments, labs, and quizzes is to be done individually. DO NOT LOOK
AT OR COPY anyone else's writing or code. DO NOT SHARE your writing or
code with anyone else. The only code you can copy is what you see in
the book and what I provide to you (in class or on this website). If
you are stuck on an assignment or lab, please visit me (or another TA)
during office hours. Suspected cases of academic misconduct will be
filed with the Committee of Academic Misconduct.</p>
