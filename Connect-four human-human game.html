    <h1>Connect-four human-human game</h1>
    <!-- Page published by Emacs Muse begins here -->
<h2>Task</h2>

<p class="first">Write a program that allows two humans to play Connect-four. The game
is briefly described below.</p>


<h2>Connect-four</h2>

<p class="first">Although I'm sure there are variants on this game, what's described
here is how we will play it.</p>

<p>The game board is a 6x7 grid (6 rows, 7 columns). There are two
players. The players' turns alternate, and during each turn, a player
places a token in one of the columns. The token slides to the &quot;bottom&quot;
of the column, as if the game board was vertical (6 rows vertically, 7
rows horizontally). So the first move of the game would have the token
at the bottom of the column in which it is place (the token would be
at row 6); if the other player then plays in the same column, that
player's token would be above the other player's token (so the new
token is at row 5), etc.</p>

<p>A player wins when four tokens, from the same player, are arranged
either horizontally (all on the same row), vertically (all in the same
column), or diagonally (each token one column left or right, one row
up or down, from another token), consecutively (no breaks).</p>

<p>Call one player &quot;A&quot; and the other &quot;B&quot;. Label their respective tokens
&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; also. Then an empty game board looks like this (with the
columns labeled with numbers):</p>

<pre class="example">
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
</pre>

<p>If player &quot;A&quot; puts a token in column 4, then the game board looks like
this:</p>

<pre class="example">
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | |A| | | |
---------------
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
</pre>

<p>And so on. Here is what an interactive game looks like:</p>

<pre class="example">

| | | | | | | |

| |B|A|A| | | |
---------------
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Player A, choose a column:
</pre>

<p>Here is a winning game:</p>

<pre class="example">
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
|A| |B| | |A| |
---------------
|B|A|B| |B|B| |
---------------
|A|A|A|B|A|B| |
---------------
|B|B|A|A|A|B|A|
---------------
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Player A won!
</pre>

<p>The winning condition is shown with dollar signs below:</p>

<pre class="example">
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
|$| |B| | |A| |
---------------
|B|$|B| |B|B| |
---------------
|A|A|$|B|A|B| |
---------------
|B|B|A|$|A|B|A|
---------------
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Player A won!
</pre>

<p>Once a player reaches a winning condition, the game should stop, and
the program should show the message &quot;Player A won!&quot; (or &quot;Player B
won!&quot;).</p>

<p>If the player chooses a column that is invalid (less than 1 or greater
than 7) or full (the column has no more empty rows), then the program
should ask for a new column choice:</p>

<pre class="example">
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Player A, choose a column: 100
Invalid column number.
Player A, choose a column:
</pre>

<pre class="example">
---------------
|B| | | | | | |
---------------
|A| | | | | | |
---------------
|B| | | | | | |
---------------
|A| | | | | | |
---------------
|B| | | | | | |
---------------
|A| | | | | | |
---------------
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Player A, choose a column: 1
Column full.
Player A, choose a column:
</pre>







<h2>Group work</h2>

<p class="first">You can work in groups of 2 or 3 if you'd like. I need to know who you
worked with, so write all your names in a comment at the top of your
code. You only need to submit one copy of the code from one person's
email address. You will all receive the same grade.</p>


<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p class="first">After you complete this program, you'll be asked to make player &quot;A&quot; or
player &quot;B&quot; a computer player, so you will have one or more extra
functions in your code that look at the game grid and determine the
best move (or the worst move, depending). Rather than asking the user
for a move from player &quot;A&quot; (or &quot;B&quot;), your program will just make the
move automatically.</p>

<p>Then we will have a quick competition in class, in which I link your
computer player with others that the class has programmed, and my
own. We'll see whose player is statistically best (by running
something like 1000 games for each pairing). The winning group, or
myself, gets a couple bars of vegan chocolate (sorry if you don't want
chocolate).</p>
