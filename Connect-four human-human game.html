    <h1>Connect-four human-human game</h1>
    <!-- Page published by Emacs Muse begins here -->
<h2>Task</h2>

<p class="first">Write a program that allows two humans to play Connect-four. The game
is briefly described below.</p>


<h2>Connect-four</h2>

<p class="first">Although I'm sure there are variants on this game, what's described
here is how we will play it.</p>

<p>The game board is a 6x7 grid (6 rows, 7 columns). There are two
players. The players' turns alternate, and during each turn, a player
places a token in one of the columns. The token slides to the &quot;bottom&quot;
of the column, as if the game board was vertical (6 rows vertically, 7
rows horizontally). So the first move of the game would have the token
at the bottom of the column in which it is place (the token would be
at row 6); if the other player then plays in the same column, that
player's token would be above the other player's token (so the new
token is at row 5), etc.</p>

<p>A player wins when four tokens, from the same player, are arranged
either horizontally (all on the same row), vertically (all in the same
column), or diagonally (each token one column left or right, one row
up or down, from another token), consecutively (no breaks).</p>

<p>Call one player &quot;A&quot; and the other &quot;B&quot;. Label their respective tokens
&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; also. Then an empty game board looks like this (with the
columns labeled with numbers):</p>

<pre class="example">
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
</pre>

<p>If player &quot;A&quot; puts a token in column 4, then the game board looks like
this:</p>

<pre class="example">
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | |A| | | |
---------------
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
</pre>

<p>And so on. Here is what an interactive game looks like:</p>

<pre class="example">

---------------
| |B|A|A| | | |
---------------
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Player A, choose a column:
</pre>

<p>Here is a winning game:</p>

<pre class="example">
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
|A| |B| | |A| |
---------------
|B|A|B| |B|B| |
---------------
|A|A|A|B|A|B| |
---------------
|B|B|A|A|A|B|A|
---------------
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Player A won!
</pre>

<p>The winning condition is shown with dollar signs below:</p>

<pre class="example">
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
| | | | | | | |
---------------
|$| |B| | |A| |
---------------
|B|$|B| |B|B| |
---------------
|A|A|$|B|A|B| |
---------------
|B|B|A|$|A|B|A|
---------------
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Player A won!
</pre>

<p>Once a player reaches a winning condition, the game should stop, and
the program should show the message &quot;Player A won!&quot; (or &quot;Player B
won!&quot;).</p>

<p>If the player chooses a column that is invalid (less than 1 or greater
than 7) or full (the column has no more empty rows), then the program
should ask for a new column choice:</p>

<pre class="example">
---------------
| | | | | | | |

| | | | | | | |

Player A, choose a column:

<h2>Hints</h2>

<p class="first">My program has the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>A &quot;global&quot; grid (defined above all other functions), which is a 2D
array of <code>char</code> values. The grid is initialized so that every value
is a space. When a player moves, I change somewhere in the grid to
either the character <code>'A'</code> or <code>'B'</code>.</li>

<li>A function <code>initializeGrid()</code> (no arguments, no return value) that
sets all the grid positions to a space.</li>

<li>A function <code>printGrid()</code> (no arguments, no return value) that shows
the grid with dashes and vertical bars (as shown above).</li>

<li>A function <code>columnFull(int col)</code> (argument is the column to check);
returns a <code>bool</code> that is true if the column is full, false otherwise.</li>

<li>A function <code>addToColumn(int col, char symbol)</code> that changes the
grid, at the appropriate row, so that player <code>'A'</code> or <code>'B'</code> has a new
token in the bottom of that column (<code>symbol</code> is either <code>'A'</code> or <code>'B'</code> to
indicate which token is being added). This function has no return
value.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>A function <code>won(char player)</code> that checks whether <code>player</code> won by
asking the above four functions (hidden for the moment) if any
winning condition for <code>player</code> can be found. Returns <code>bool</code>.</li>

<li>A function <code>playerMove(char player)</code> that asks the player to make a
move, and tells the player the move is invalid if that is the
case. Returns <code>bool</code>, where true means the move was valid and the
grid has been updated (by the <code>addToColumn</code> function), or <code>false</code> if
the move was invalid.</li>

<li>The <code>main</code> function, that repeatedly asks the players to move
(switching between players), and for each player, asks that player
to move so long as their moves continue to fail (when <code>playerMove</code>
returns false). This function also checks whether each player won
after their move is performed, and if a player has won, quits the
program.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Group work</h2>

<p class="first">You can work in groups of 2 or 3 if you'd like. I need to know who you
worked with, so write all your names in a comment at the top of your
code. You only need to submit one copy of the code from one person's
email address. You will all receive the same grade.</p>


<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p class="first">After you complete this program, you'll be asked to make player &quot;A&quot; or
player &quot;B&quot; a computer player, so you will have one or more extra
functions in your code that look at the game grid and determine the
best move (or the worst move, depending). Rather than asking the user
for a move from player &quot;A&quot; (or &quot;B&quot;), your program will just make the
move automatically.</p>

<p>Then we will have a quick competition in class, in which I link your
computer player with others that the class has programmed, and my
own. We'll see whose player is statistically best (by running
something like 1000 games for each pairing). The winning group, or
myself, gets a couple bars of vegan chocolate (sorry if you don't want
chocolate).</p>
