    <h1>Lab 2</h1>
    <!-- Page published by Emacs Muse begins here -->
<h2>Task</h2>

<p class="first">Write a complete program that asks the user to input an integer
representing the number of seconds from now until some event will
happen in the future or did happen in the past. Your program will
convert that number into days, hours, minutes, and seconds and tell
the user the results of this conversion. If the user entered a
negative number of seconds, your program will say the event happened
&quot;D days, H hours, M minutes, and S seconds ago&quot;; if the user entered a
positive number of seconds, your program will say the same thing but
change &quot;ago&quot; to &quot;from now&quot;.</p>


<h2>Examples</h2>

<p class="first">Be sure your program works with the following examples:</p>

<pre class="example">
Enter number of seconds: 0
0 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds from now.
</pre>

<pre class="example">
Enter number of seconds: 55
0 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes, 55 seconds from now.
</pre>

<pre class="example">
Enter number of seconds: -55
0 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes, 55 seconds ago.
</pre>

<pre class="example">
Enter number of seconds: 1000
0 days, 0 hours, 16 minutes, 40 seconds from now.
</pre>

<pre class="example">
Enter number of seconds: -1000
0 days, 0 hours, 16 minutes, 40 seconds ago.
</pre>

<pre class="example">
Enter number of seconds: 12345678
142 days, 21 hours, 21 minutes, 18 seconds from now.
</pre>

<pre class="example">
Enter number of seconds: -12345678
142 days, 21 hours, 21 minutes, 18 seconds ago.
</pre>



<h2>Academic misconduct policy</h2>

<p class="first">All writing (prose) and coding for every one of the programming
assignments, labs, and quizzes is to be done individually. DO NOT LOOK
AT OR COPY anyone else's writing or code. DO NOT SHARE your writing or
code with anyone else. The only code you can copy is what you see in
the book and what I provide to you (in class or on this website). If
you are stuck on an assignment or lab, please visit me (or another TA)
during office hours. Suspected cases of academic misconduct will be
filed with the Committee of Academic Misconduct.</p>
